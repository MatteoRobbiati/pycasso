# pycasso
Pycasso is an automatic image processing tool based on the [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) package.

I was tired to use graphical apps to remove backgrounds and replace colors, and 
now I am happy to have `pycasso` helping me.

## Install it

In order to install `pycasso`, just open your terminal, clone this repo and use the 
`pip` installation command:

```sh
pip install .
```
You can know use it as you wish.

## Tutorial
